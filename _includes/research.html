  <h4>Nebular Emission in FSPS</h4>
    <article>
      <p>I have implemented a gas model within <a style="color:#333; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://github.com/cconroy20/fsps">FSPS</a> that self-consistently computes the contribution of nebular line and continuum emission for stellar populations using the photoionization code <code>Cloudy</code>. The model is described in <a style="color:#333; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...840...44B">Byler+2017</a>.</p><br>
      <p>You can use FSPS or <a style="color:#333; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://dan.iel.fm/python-fsps/current/">python-FSPS</a> to compute the nebular contribution for complex stellar populations. The nebular model is self-consistent for stellar populations generated using <a style="color:#333; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://waps.cfa.harvard.edu/MIST/">MIST</a>, Padova, PARSEC, and BPASS evolutionary tracks.</p>

      <h4>Cloudy + FSPS</h4>
      <p>The nebular model was generated with the <a style="color:#333; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://nell-byler.github.io/cloudyfsps/">cloudyFSPS</a> package. Visit the project page (<a style="color:#333; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://nell-byler.github.io/cloudyfsps/">nell-byler.github.io/cloudyfsps</a>) to download emission line tables or to find more information on pairing FSPS with <code>Cloudy</code>.</p>

    <h4>The UV properties of star-forming galaxies</h4>
    <article>
      <p>Light emitted from the first galaxies in the universe has been substantially redshifted: photons that are emitted in the ultraviolet (UV) will be observable in the infrared. Studies of these first galaxies with next-generation facilities (e.g., the <i> James Webb Space Telescope </i>) will thus rely on UV diagnostics. While diagnostics in the optical are well-characterized, UV diagnostics are not well established. I published a suite of UV emission and absorption line diagnostics in <a style="color:#333; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...863...14B">Byler+2018</a>, and I am currently working on comparing different galactic properties derived with UV and optical diagnostics.</p>

    <h4>LIER-like emission from post-AGB stars</h4>
      <article>
        <p> In <a style="color:#333; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AJ....158....2B/abstract">Byler+2019</a>, I explored the ionizing properties and colors of hot, evolved stars. I found that post-AGB stars naturally reproduce LIER-like emission line ratios and equivalent widths, and that a small population of blue horizontal brainch stars can explain the UV-excess seen in some early-type galaxies. Tables of emission line ratios can be found <a style="color:#333; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mNQFpy8heWh5wRqnScbrYH3DVfucMyBa">here</a>.</p>

    <h4>Using resolved stellar populations to characterize biases in spectral fitting</h4>
    <article>
      <p>I am interested in the intersection of resolved star studies of galaxies and integrated light studies of galaxies. For nearby galaxies, we can study both perspectives simultaneously: HST imaging reveals the resolved stellar populations and SDSS-IV MaNGA IFUs provide the spatially resolved spectroscopy. My research focuses on characterizing the translation of integrated light into meaningful astrophysical quantities of galaxies, especially on sub-kpc scales where stochastic processes can cause widely-used approximations to break down.</p><br>

      <p><em>Other research interests</em></p><br>
      <p> From the resolved stellar population side of things, I use evolved stars in M31 to constrain stellar evolution models as a part of  <a style="color:#333; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.astro.washington.edu/groups/phat/Home.html">PHAT</a>. I am also really excited about 2D spectroscopic surveys of galaxies, and have worked on both <a style="color:#333; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.sdss.org/dr13/manga/manga-target-selection/ancillary-targets/detangling-galaxy-spectra-using-resolved-stars/">survey science</a> and <a style="color:#333; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://blog.sdss3.org/2013/01/23/demonstrating-the-manga-instrument-at-apo/">instrumentation</a> as a part of MaNGA.</p><br>
