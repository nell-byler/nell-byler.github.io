    <h4>Nebular Emission in FSPS</h4>
    <article>
      <p>I have implemented a nebular model within <a style="color:#333; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://github.com/cconroy20/fsps">FSPS</a> that self-consistently computes the contribution of nebular line and continuum emission for stellar populations using the photoionization code <code>Cloudy</code>. A description of the model can be found <a style="color:#333; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08305">here</a> and a list of the included emission lines can be found <a style="color:#333; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://nell-byler.github.io/research/emissionLines.html">here</a>.</p><br>
      <p>Users can also use <a style="color:#333; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://dan.iel.fm/python-fsps/current/">python-FSPS</a> to compute the nebular contribution for complex stellar populations. The nebular model is self-consistent for stellar populations generated using both <a style="color:#333; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://waps.cfa.harvard.edu/MIST/">MIST</a> and Padova evolutionary tracks.</p><br>

      <br><br><p>The nebular model was generated with the cloudyFSPS package. For more information on pairing FSPS models with Cloudy, visit the <a style="color:#333; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://nell-byler.github.io/cloudyfsps/">project page</a>.</p>

    <h4>Using resolved stellar populations to characterize biases in spectral fitting</h4>

      <p>I am interested in the intersection of resolved star studies of galaxies and integrated light studies of galaxies. For nearby galaxies, we can study both perspectives simultaneously: HST imaging reveals the resolved stellar populations and SDSS-IV MaNGA IFUs provide the spatially resolved spectroscopy. My research focuses on characterizing the translation of integrated light into meaningful astrophysical quantities of galaxies, especially on sub-kpc scales where stochastic processes can cause widely-used approximations to break down.</p>

      <p> From the resolved stellar population side of things, I use evolved stars in M31 to constrain stellar evolution models as a part of  <a style="color:#333; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.astro.washington.edu/groups/phat/Home.html">PHAT</a>. I am also really excited about 2D spectroscopic surveys of galaxies, and have worked on both <a style="color:#333; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.sdss.org/dr13/manga/manga-target-selection/ancillary-targets/detangling-galaxy-spectra-using-resolved-stars/">survey science</a> and <a style="color:#333; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://blog.sdss3.org/2013/01/23/demonstrating-the-manga-instrument-at-apo/">instrumentation</a> as a part of MaNGA.</p><br>
