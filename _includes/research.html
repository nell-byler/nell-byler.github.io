        <p>I am interested in the intersection of resolved star studies of galaxies and integrated light studies of galaxies. For nearby galaxies, we can study both perspectives simultaneously: HST imaging reveals the resolved stellar populations and MaNGA IFUs provide the spatially resolved spectroscopy. My thesis work is focused on characterizing the translation of observed flux into meaningful astrophysical quantities of galaxies on  sub-kpc scales, where stochastic processes can cause widely-used approximations to break down.</p><br>
        <p> From the resolved stellar population side of things, I use evolved stars in M31 to constrain stellar evolution models as a part of  <a href="http://www.astro.washington.edu/groups/phat/Home.html">PHAT</a>. On the integrated light side of things, I am working on properly accounting for emission from nebular regions within galaxies in stellar population synthesis models. I am also really excited about 2D spectroscopic surveys of galaxies, and have worked on both survey science and instrumentation as a part of <a href="http://blog.sdss3.org/2013/01/23/demonstrating-the-manga-instrument-at-apo/">MaNGA!</a></p><br>
